/*!
  This function gets the input file name from the argument list.
  For most cases, this is simply the first
  command-line argument (after the program name).
  The variable @c input_filename is set to the filename,
  and all arguments following it are shifed down one.
  Unless you are a developer, this is all you need to know.

  For the special case with no command-line argument,
  if the program is invoked with the name "check-blah",
  it assumes the input file is "blah.input".
  The purpose of this setup is so that it is compatible with
  the automake make-check mechanism, which runs programs without
  arguments.  At the same time, an input file can be manually
  specified for operational flexibility.

  @return 0 if filename is found, 1 otherwise.
